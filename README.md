# What is DynamicWall?
The aim of this UWP app  is to create an interface in which a dynamic wallpaper and lockscreen similar to Mac OS Mojave can be achived. Being a begginer, Any help or support would be much appreatieated. There is a lot to do still.

# Where are we at the moment?
With a simple schedule,   the wallpaper changes based on the hour of the day. The process should run compleatly in the background every 60 min but so far i was not able to start it due to bugs in the code. (It would be much appreciated if someone caould point out the mistakes).

# Where do we want to go?
The concept of a dynamic wallpaper and lockscreen has many potentials, but here are some concepts to start with:
1. Wallpaper and lockscreen pictures based on the time of the day and times of sunrise and sunset. a cs has been written with the API of [SunriseSunset](sunrise-sunset.org/api) and [IP Location](ip-api.com). However, it has not yet been implimented.
2. Wallpaper and lockscreen pictures based on the current local weather using the previusly mentioned APIs.
3. changing the set of the dynamic wallpaper automatically based on prefered themes of the user.
4. Adding an option through the app interface to insert custom images for the Time-of-day presets or weather condition presets.
